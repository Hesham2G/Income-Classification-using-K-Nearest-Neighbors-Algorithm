**Project Name**: **Income Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm**

**Project Description**:  
This project utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify individuals' income levels based on personal and professional attributes. The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values and invalid data, followed by encoding categorical variables into numerical representations. 

An extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to visualize the distribution of key features and investigate the relationships between variables, specifically focusing on income classification. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets, and the KNN algorithm is applied with various values of K to identify the optimal value for achieving the highest classification accuracy. 

To enhance the model's performance, MinMax scaling is applied to normalize the data, and GridSearchCV is used to fine-tune hyperparameters for improved results. The primary objective of this project is to build an effective income classification model that can predict whether an individual falls into a high or low-income bracket, based on their characteristics.

This project demonstrates practical application of machine learning techniques, data preprocessing, and model evaluation, providing a comprehensive solution for income prediction tasks.
